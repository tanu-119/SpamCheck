#  SMS Spam Classification using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham** (not spam). It utilizes text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and various classification algorithms to identify unwanted messages with high accuracy.

---

## Objective

To develop a robust spam classification model that accurately detects spam SMS messages using natural language processing and supervised learning techniques.

---

## Dataset
- **Structure**:
  - `v1`: Label (spam/ham)
  - `v2`: Message text

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- string (for text cleaning)

---

## Models Used

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

---

## Evaluation Metrics
Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, F1-score via Classification Report
